This project was tasked to meet the following criteria:

```
GIVEN I am using a daily planner to create a schedule
WHEN I open the planner
THEN the current day is displayed at the top of the calendar
WHEN I scroll down
THEN I am presented with time blocks for standard business hours
WHEN I view the time blocks for that day
THEN each time block is color-coded to indicate whether it is in the past, present, or future
WHEN I click into a time block
THEN I can enter an event
WHEN I click the save button for that time block
THEN the text for that event is saved in local storage
WHEN I refresh the page
THEN the saved events persist

```
## Screenshots

My website is meant to emulate the following gif:

## Things I learned in making this website:
 - I gained a better understanding of objects and how to pull data from them
 - I became better as pacing myself in how I work. I worked on bits at a time and walked away as soon as I felt myself getting too in the weeds on something.
 - I became more comfortable with using localStorage
 - Bootstrap is my best friend and you can pry it from my cold dead hands
 - I still do not leave myself a lot of time to finalize styling. I focus much more on functionality than on looks. But this is true in all aspects of my  life.
